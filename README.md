# Incorrect div tag closure within innerHTML
This example demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to manipulating the innerHTML property of an element. The problem arises when a parent div tag is closed prematurely within a string assigned to the innerHTML property, disrupting the document's structure and potentially causing unexpected layout issues.
The bug is subtle and might go unnoticed during initial development or testing.  The solution involves carefully examining the structure of the HTML string being assigned to innerHTML, ensuring proper opening and closing tags, and avoiding nested closures within the string.
